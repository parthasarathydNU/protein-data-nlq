## Illuminating the Unknown: Enhancing Protein Function Discovery in Plasmodium falciparum Through a Natural Language Query System

### Summary and Explanation of the Use Case

#### Overview
The project involves developing a Natural Language Query (NLQ) system tailored for biologists working with genomic data, particularly focusing on the malaria-causing parasite, *Plasmodium falciparum* for example. One of the key challenge addressed by the NLQ system is the identification and annotation of hypothetical proteins whose functions are unknown. This system aims to leverage existing genomic data, domain predictions, and cross-species protein sequence comparisons to hypothesize functions for these proteins.

#### Context
*Plasmodium falciparum* is known for its significant proportion of hypothetical proteins, with about 40% of its genes currently uncharacterized. These proteins are labeled as "hypothetical" because their functions have not been experimentally validated and are often not targeted for research due to the lack of known functional data.

#### Technical Details
1. **Gene and Protein Identification**: Proteins in *Plasmodium falciparum* are identified by gene IDs (like PF3d_01107), which are part of broader databases such as UniProt.
2. **Domain Prediction**: Tools like Smart and Pfam are used to predict protein domains based on conserved sequences across species. These domains often suggest potential functions based on known sequences in other organisms, such as humans or fruit flies.
3. **BLAST Searches**: BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is used to compare *Plasmodium* protein sequences against databases of proteins from other organisms. This helps in identifying similar sequences where the function is known, thereby hypothesizing potential functions for the hypothetical proteins.
4. **Functional Extrapolation**: By identifying conserved domains or sequence similarities with functionally annotated proteins in other species, biologists can infer potential functions for *Plasmodium* proteins.

#### Use Case Scenario
A biologist is investigating a group of hypothetical proteins in *Plasmodium falciparum*. They want to know:
- Which of these proteins are predicted to have specific domains known to be associated with particular biological functions?
- How many of these proteins can be linked to functions known in other organisms through domain matching or sequence similarity?

The biologist uses the NLQ system to query:
- "Show hypothetical proteins with predicted Smart or Pfam domains."
- "List proteins similar to human heart proteins identified in fruit flies."

#### Purpose of the NLQ System
The NLQ system will:
- Allow biologists to easily query genomic data using natural language, making the data more accessible and actionable without requiring deep technical expertise in bioinformatics.
- Help prioritize proteins for experimental research by identifying those with potential functions inferred from computational data, thus guiding experimental efforts more effectively.

#### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Accelerates the research process by providing quick answers to functional queries about proteins.
- **Discovery**: Aids in discovering potential new functions for proteins that are otherwise not well studied.
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps in better resource allocation by allowing researchers to focus on proteins with the highest potential impact or relevance to their studies.

### Conclusion
The NLQ system we are developing aims to transform how biologists access and interact with complex genomic data. By enabling intuitive querying of protein functions and domain information, the system will significantly enhance the capability of researchers to make informed decisions about which proteins to study further, potentially leading to new insights into the biology of *Plasmodium falciparum* and other organisms. This tool will be instrumental in shedding light on the 'dark matter' of genomic data, where many sequences have not yet been functionally characterized.
