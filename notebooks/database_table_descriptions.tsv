Table	Description
codon_usage	This table stores data about the usage frequency and abundance of each codon. Codons are sequences of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that correspond to a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. Each row represents a codon, its corresponding amino acid, and its frequency and abundance metrics in the genome.
gene_aliases	This table contains alias names for gene IDs. It helps in linking various names or identifiers that a single gene might be known by in different studies or databases. Each row contains a gene ID followed by multiple columns for potential aliases, helping to consolidate gene identification across different scientific literature or databases.
gene_annotations	The gene_annotations table stores detailed annotations for genes. This includes the source of the annotation, symbols, Gene Ontology IDs, references, evidence types, aspects (like biological process, cellular component, etc.), descriptions, synonyms, gene types, taxon identifiers, the date of annotation, and the organization that assigned the annotation.
gff_annotations	This table contains annotations from GFF (General Feature Format) files which are used to describe genes, gene structure, and other features of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The table includes fields such as the sequence ID, source, type of feature (like exon, intron, UTR), start and stop positions, score, strand, phase, and a free-text attributes field that can include IDs and descriptions.
protein_data	The protein_data table holds information related to proteins, including entries, organisms they are associated with, the length of the proteins, the first and last seen dates of the proteins in studies or databases, organism IDs, protein names, amino acid sequences, domain information (Pfam, SMART), amino acid composition, average hydrophobicity, and secondary structure descriptions. This table is crucial for understanding protein characteristics and their functions in various organisms.
